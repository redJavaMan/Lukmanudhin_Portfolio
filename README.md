PROJECTS

Title: Automated End-to-End Testing Framework for Web Applications using Cucumber and Selenium

Description:
Developed and implemented a robust Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework using Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver to automate end-to-end testing for web applications, ensuring high-quality user experiences by validating application behavior against predefined Gherkin scenarios. Designed and maintained Page Object Model (POM) classes to enhance code reusability and maintainability, configured and executed test suites across multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) using Maven, and generated detailed test reports (HTML, JSON, XML) stored in target/cucumber-reports for analysis and debugging. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to align test cases with business requirements, ensuring comprehensive workflow coverage, and contributed to project documentation, including setup instructions, configuration guidelines, and contribution processes.
Skills: Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Cucumber,(BDD), Maven, Page Object Model

Title: Emirates E-Commerce UI/API Test Automation Framework

Description:
Developed and maintained an end-to-end test automation framework for Emirates' e-commerce platform, validating critical user journeys such as shopping cart functionality (item addition, counter validation, cart totals) and multi-currency conversion workflows. Integrated Selenium WebDriver with RestAssured to perform UI automation and API-based exchange rate verification. Implemented parallel test execution (TestNG) with a 2-thread configuration, reducing test suite runtime by 40%. Utilized the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable code and Allure Framework for interactive test reporting. Features included cross-browser compatibility, automated screenshot capture on failure, and CI/CD pipeline integration via Maven.
